A low pass filter was developed to meet that need. It was set after the Op-Amp to reduce noise further. The Op-Amp is critical, because the electret microphone selected for the team board outputs a very weak signal. The ADC selected for this project was selected for its I2S communication pins. </p> <p>This selection meets our product requirements for both our goals, as well as our technical requirements as follows:</p> <ul> <li>Functions as an I2C communication sensing input</li> <li>Aides to educate on scientific concept of audio waves</li> <li>Allows for accessibility for children</li> <li>Aligns with technical goals of product requirements</li> <li>Can educate on basics, and not overwhelm</li> </ul>"},{"location":"Datasheet/Schematic/","title":"Schematic For Audio Input PCB","text":""},{"location":"Datasheet/Schematic/#image-1-carter-oneills-schematic-for-team-203","title":"Image 1: Carter ONeill's Schematic for Team 203","text":"<p> My schematic satisfies the needs of the k-12 children expected to use this equipment by providing them a means of interacting with our model vocally.

I had great difficulty debugging my ESP-32 due to many of the pins either being assigned to GND with no jumper or pins being mapped wrong. I was satisfied with the amount of debugging LED's I used, but due to my inability to even get my ESP programmed they were not used. I had accidentally set the wrong USB data pins on my PCB, and the lack of spare jumper points made the re-routing of the signal perilously difficult. Furthermore, my board was populated with sections for 0 ohm resistors, which ended up being a painful and less than useful compromise compared to jumpers. I would also add more GPIO pins in the future, since the ESP GPIO pins are readily configurable, if they aren't being left open for programming it is essentially a waste.</p> <p>My second greatest hurdle was the issues with the voltage regulator. Even after ordering a better inductor, and double checking the capacitors, the regulator did not output stable voltage. I was able to test the rest of my components with steady DC output from a bench supply to compensate. Oscilloscope testing did show the capacitors behaving as expected, but I believe the inductor was ultimately unequipped for the regulation.</p> <p>Starting the testing process earlier, and overcoming these issues earlier would have allowed me to thrive later in the course.</p>"},{"location":"PCB-Design-Files/PCB-Layout/","title":"Final PCB Layout for Microphone Input","text":""},{"location":"PCB-Design-Files/PCB-Layout/#one-sided-pcb-top-view","title":"One sided PCB, Top View","text":""},{"location":"PCB-Design-Files/PCB-Layout/#gerber-files","title":"Gerber Files","text":"<p>PCB Gerber</p>"},{"location":"PCB-Design-Files/PCB-Layout/#project-files","title":"Project files","text":"<p>Project Zip</p>"},{"location":"Resources/Resources/","title":"Code ESP32","text":"<p>Download ZIP</p>"},{"location":"Selection%20Process/PIC%20Table%20Example/","title":"PIC Tables","text":""},{"location":"Selection%20Process/PIC%20Table%20Example/#table-1-component-selection","title":"Table 1: Component Selection","text":""},{"location":"Selection%20Process/PIC%20Table%20Example/#power-supply","title":"Power Supply","text":"Solution Pros Cons Option 1: TPS7A4700RGWT Surface mount linear voltage regulator  $5.86/each Link to product * Smaller footprint * Price Option 2: LM2675MX 3.3v 1A surface mount switching regulator  $4.36/each Link to product * Surface mount variation of the one we are familiar with from class * Bigger Footprint"},{"location":"Selection%20Process/PIC%20Table%20Example/#choice-option-2-lm2675mx-33v-1a-surface-mount-switching-regulator","title":"Choice: Option 2: LM2675MX 3.3v 1A surface mount switching regulator","text":"<p>Rationale: While the SOIC footprint takes up more space, ultimately it will be easier to solder to my PCB.

Indeed, you should be able to remove everything other than <code>tex-chtml.js</code>, and the <code>input/tex/extensions</code>, <code>output/chtml/fonts/woff-v2</code>, <code>adaptors</code>, <code>a11y</code>, and <code>sre</code> directories.  If you are using the results only on the web, you can remove <code>adaptors</code> as well.</p> <p>If you are not using A11Y support (e.g., speech generation, or semantic enrichment), then you can remove <code>a11y</code> and <code>sre</code> as well (though in this case you may need to disable the assistive tools in the MathJax contextual menu in order to avoid MathJax trying to load them when they aren't there).</p> <p>If you are using SVG rather than CommonHTML output (e.g., <code>tex-svg.js</code> rather than <code>tex-chtml.js</code>), you can remove the <code>output/chtml/fonts/woff-v2</code> directory.
