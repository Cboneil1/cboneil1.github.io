## This is my personal website for class 314 MW 9am

Some things about **me**:

- I am studying Electrical Systems Engineering
- This is my first time taking a class with Dan Aukes
- I like to bake desserts as a hobby, but I dislike decorating food. I am in it for the bread

## I am not a morning person, yet

But, I also do not drink **coffee**. [WHAT??? you must feel so tired](https://www.thewellnesscorner.com/blog/reasons-you-maybe-sleepy-all-the-time). *Go figure*

1. Is it hard to roll out of bed in the mornings without coffee?

    Yes:

        if (DrinkCoffee== true){
            panic_attack==HIGH;}

2. If I drink tea in the morning

    > Tea doesnt help at all and it tastes bad

3. Just dealing with it


Thanks for viewing.
