## This is the website for Carter ONeill's report
Our greater project was of a system to take input from an audio mic and convert the frequency information to a pitch, and then convert that pitch to a physical wave via motors. My section specifically was for the portion that handled the audio input.

The electret microphone on the PCB sent the audio to an Op-Amp, which was sent to an ADC, and output to the ESP-32 via I2S communication.
