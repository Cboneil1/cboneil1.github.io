The power budget highlights how efficient my system is, and demonstrates the need for a switching regulator. Running a linear regulator with this setup would generate a lot of heat. The components I am using will likely be lower energy than calculated here, in the tens of milliamps, due to the majority of accessories being excluded from use.
